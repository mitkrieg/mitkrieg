### Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Mitch Krieger and I'm a creative data scientist and design thinker with experience in python, statistical analysis, machine learning, and time series analysis. With a background in math education and non-profit management, I use data storytelling to help make numbers, data, and abstract ideas make sense to people and organizations so that they can make informed data-driven decisions. I currently work for [BlockFi](http://blockfi.com/) as a Business Intelligence Analyst working with cryptocurrency data data across finance, compliance, fraud, and PeopleOps verticals.

## Highlighted Projects

#### [Rebalancing the Citibike System](https://github.com/mitkrieg/citibike-timeseries)

Citibike in NYC and other similar bike-sharing systems face a unique challenge in balancing their system. Bikes must be distributed across all stations so that riders have access to both bikes to take out and empty docks to return bikes to. Unchecked, this challenge may cause bikes to pool in a certain station and drain from others. This project attempts to understand which stations in the Citibike system are pools, drains, or balanced. To accomplish this, time series analysis was implemented in Python/Jupyter Notebook to predict the number of bikes at a given station given the time. Then based on their extracted seasonality from the time series model, stations were classified as pools, drains, or balanced using clustering. Lastly, an interactive dashboard was created to provide a system overview of visualizations and station modeling.

#### [Predicting Kickstarter Project Success](https://github.com/griffinhundley/kickstarter_success)

Kickstarter only recieves revenue when projects only get fully funded by backers. In light of that, this project investigated what factors lead to the complete funding (success) or failure of a Kickstarter project by creating classification models in Python/Jupyter Notebook to predict the success or failure of 191,875 kickstarter projects launched between April 2009 and October 2020. Our final model was able to predict success (a project is fully funded by backers) or failure of a project with 80% accuracy using only information that is would be available to creators at project launch.

#### [Alzheimers Progression Classifier using Coronal MRI](https://github.com/Jacobheyman702/Alzheimer_Image_classifier-)

This project attemps to classify images of coronal MRIs of Alzheimers patient's brains into one of 4 progressive stages of demensia using convoluted nerual networks and transfer learning. The goal was to create a model that could be used as a preliminary diagnosis for new patients with early signs of dimentia and limit false negatives. We created several neural networks in Keras/Tensorflow and leveraged transfer learning to improve the recall metric, but ultimately the model was limited by regular brain aging, the overlap between the classes, and the large variance in the non-demented class.

#### [Predicting Credit Card Defaults](https://github.com/mitkrieg/predicting-defaults)

To optimize returns, Banks must manage their risk when providing credit cards to customers. This project attempts to create a model that predicts if a client will or will not default on their credit card loan. This project was a competition with classmates to see who could achieve the model with the best F-1 scores that predicts people who will default on a holdout dataset. My best model was a random forrest and had an F-1 score of .56 on the test portion of the dataset. When the holdout competition dataset was run through the model it performed 3rd best in the class.

#### [Predicting Housing Prices in King Count, WA](https://github.com/mitkrieg/predicting-housing-prices)

Real Estate agents must be able to assess value of a home to better be able to market, negotiate the price and eventually sell the home. The goal of this project is to predict housing prices as acurately as possible prices with a somewhat interpretable model, allowing the agent to understand what factors lead to a more expensive home and estimate what the value of the home should be. Ultimately, through mutliple linear regression using various features, prices for houses in a test set were predicted with an RMSE of \$165,802.93

#### [Journey HOme: A Gravity Based Game](https://github.com/mitkrieg/Gravity)

You are an astronaut whose drifting ship has run out of fuel. As you inexplicably possess the ability to place heavenly objects, your only hope for survival is using the gravitational pull of space things to affect your trajectory and get you home. Journey home is a python based video game using the pygame library. [Game Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnXRUZDFae4&feature=emb_logo)
