### Hello 👋

I am a Machine Learning Engineer & Data Scientist based in New York City with a passion for collaborating with business partners to design machine-learning models and AI-driven solutions that enhance product offerings and empower data-driven decision-making. 

What sets me apart is my dual expertise in data science and education. Before transitioning into tech, I was an interdisciplinary teacher, education administrator, and designer with a focus on reimagining mathematics education. My background in educational technology and curriculum development has given me a unique skill set: the ability to craft compelling data stories that resonate with both technical and non-technical stakeholders. I bridge the gap between data and decision-makers, ensuring that everyone—from C-suite executives to frontline teams—can harness the power of data in their work. Whether I’m optimizing an industry classification model, conducting academic research to guide model development, designing interactive tools for client management, or presenting at a conference, my focus is always on creating data solutions that are both impactful and understandable. I currently am getting my Master's in Computer Science with a focus in Machine Learning at [Cornell Tech](https://tech.cornell.edu/) (Cornell University's tech campus in NYC). Previously, I worked as a data scientist at [Middesk](http://middesk.com) helping to build/manage machine learning modlels that powered the core engine of Middesk's business identity platform. Prior to that, I worked at BlockFi, where I leveraged cryptocurrency data across the finance, compliance, fraud, and client services verticals to drive business results. 

Let’s connect if you’re interested in the intersection of data science, machine learning / AI, education, and business strategy!
