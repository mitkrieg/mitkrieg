### Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Mitch Krieger and I'm a creative data scientist and design thinker with experience in python, statistical analysis, machine learning, and time series analysis. With a background in math education and non-profit management, I use data storytelling to help make numbers, data, and abstract ideas make sense to people and organizations so that they can make informed data-driven decisions.

## Projects

#### [Rebalancing the Citibike System](https://github.com/mitkrieg/citibike-timeseries)

Citibike in NYC and other similar bike-sharing systems face a unique challenge in balancing their system. Bikes must be distributed across all stations so that riders have access to both bikes to take out and empty docks to return bikes to. Unchecked, this challenge may cause bikes to pool in a certain station and drain from others. This project attempts to understand which stations in the Citibike system are pools, drains, or balanced. To accomplish this, time series analysis was used to predict the number of bikes at a given station given the time and then based on their extracted seasonality from the time series model, stations were classified as pools, drains, or balanced using clustering. Lastly, an interactive dashboard was created to provide a system overview of visualizations and station modeling.

#### [Predicting Kickstarter Project Success](https://github.com/griffinhundley/kickstarter_success)

Kickstarter only recieves revenue when projects only get fully funded by backers. So, this project investigated what factors lead to the complete funding (success) or failure of a Kickstarter project by creating classification models to predict the success or failure of 191,875 kickstarter projects launched between April 2009 and October 2020. Our final model was able to predict success (a project is fully funded by backers) or failure of a project with 80% accuracy using only information that is would be available to creators at project launch.

#### [Alzheimers Progression Classifier using Coronal MRI](https://github.com/Jacobheyman702/Alzheimer_Image_classifier-)

This project attemps to classify images of coronal MRIs of Alzheimers patient's brains into one of 4 progressive stages of demensia using convoluted nerual networks and transfer learning. The goal was to create a model that could be used as a preliminary diagnosis for new patients with early signs of dimentia and limit false negatives. We created several neural networks and leveraged transfer learning to improve the recall metric, but ultimately the model was limited by regular brain aging, the overlap between the classes, and the large variance in the non-demented class.
